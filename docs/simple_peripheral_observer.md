Purpose / Scope
===============

This sample project is used to add observer role to a peripheral Bluetooth low
energy peripheral device to show scanning functionality in a peripheral based project. The project is based on
simple_peripheral. This project is configured to run on the CC2650 Launchpad. 

# Interface

Connect CC2650 LaunchPad's USB port to terminal application on the PC such as TeraTerm using 115200 8N1 serial port setup.

Scanning operation can be done simultaneously with advertising and within a BLE connection.

Operation
==========

1. Power up the device
   Press the KEY_LEFT (BTN-1) to start scanning.

1. Observe the scan results on the terminal. Scanning should complete and display the Bluetooth device addresses of the scanned devices, optionally press the KEY_RIGHT (BTN-2) to cancel scanning.
